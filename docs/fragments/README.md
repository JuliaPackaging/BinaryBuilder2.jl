# Documentation fragments

Sometimes, I have a feature that I implement that I don't want to lose track of, so I document it immediately, despite not having a full docs hierarchy that I could put it inside of.
This folder contains these "documentation fragments", so that I can eventually stitch them all together into some kind of cohesive documentation.
